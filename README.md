# AI-Powered Handwritten Exam Sheet Grading System

## Project Description
This project is an automated grading system designed to assist educators in evaluating handwritten exam papers. It uses Computer Vision to preprocess images and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text. The core innovation lies in its semantic grading engine, which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to compare student answers against a rubric based on meaning and key points rather than simple keyword matching.
